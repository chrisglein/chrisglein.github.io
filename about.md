Chris Glein is a Seattle area [game designer](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/120507/chris-glein) and [artist](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameartist/120507/chris-glein). You can find him monthly with the Seattle Tabletop Game Designers at [Blue Highway Games](https://www.bluehighwaygames.com/events/events-schedule/)'s industry meet up, playing and creating all sorts of game prototypes. He is endlessly looking for new and interesting ways to pair theme and mechanics so that he has an excuse to draw more pictures and put them on cards.

This website is a collection of in-progress and published game design projects, as well as a blog for whatever other topics seem relevant.
