I don't read books quickly. I have a hard time creating large blocks of time for reading, primarily because I have many competing hobbies and media types. The main hack to increase my "reading" has been audio books, as I can fit them alongside a walk or commute. It still means my progress is broken up into ~30 minute increments, so it's slow going (If you're looking at a 300+ page 10 hour novel... that's 20 daily trips to get through, or like 4 weeks). Also there are many times when I can't focus enough for that (I've learned that during my commute home my brain is too crowded to handle an audiobook). But I still make progress.

This year was dominated by one series in particular, because it totally captured me. And that's the __Wayfarer__ series by Becky Chambers. I cannot recommend it enough. Some musings on that and other books I "read" this year below.


## The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet"><img class="book" alt="The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet" src="/media/posts/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet.jpg"/></a>This is what I would love to see more of in science fiction. It’s optimistic, inclusive, character-focused, and more feminine in its perspective. It’s what I would hope a future _could_ look like, rather than the more common dystopian/apocalyptic/technophile envisioning. This story is more character-driven vignettes than a strong central narrative. The multi-species crew of the Wayfarer goes from point A to point B, and along the way there’s the most delightfully natural world building and character building. The stories are also often distinctly science fiction in that they could foundational not exist in our current reality (as opposed to sci-fi being mere window dressing). But also the stories are all distinctly human-relatable. Plus the audiobook performance is _incredible_; Rachel Dulude has _range_. I loved this book so so much.

## A Closed and Common Orbit
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29475447-a-closed-and-common-orbit"><img class="book" alt="A Closed and Common Orbit" src="/media/posts/a-closed-and-common-orbit.jpg"/></a>I didn't know that the second book in the “Wayfarer series” wasn’t at all about the same characters. I was petulant at first. I wanted more of what the previous book had offered! And, well, this _is_ that, but not in the way I expected. This story explores what would happen if an AI raised a human, and also explores what would happen if a human raised an AI. They’re both interesting to explore, and they intersect in interesting ways. By the end I was in love with these characters too and having a great time.

## Record of a Spaceborn Few
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32802595-record-of-a-spaceborn-few"><img class="book" alt="Record of a Spaceborn Few" src="/media/posts/record-of-a-spaceborn-few.jpg"/></a>When the third book opened up to a whole new cast  of characters I was more prepared and open minded. After two books of multi-species characters, this one focuses on a human-only story. Specifically the humans that left earth in ships and decided to stay on those ships rather than colonize another planet. It’s a story of that society, from many different angles. Of the series this was perhaps the most detailed in how things might work, what family and government and commerce might look like in an constrained but interconnected social environment.

## Galaxy and the Ground Within
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50209317-the-galaxy-and-the-ground-within"><img class="book" alt="Galaxy and the Ground Within" src="/media/posts/the-galaxy-and-the-ground-within.jpg"/></a>The final book in the series takes a complete turn from the previous one. Now the cast is _completely_ lacking any human characters, and takes place on just one hunk of rock. It’s a [bottle episode](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode), with a diverse set of anatomy and culture involved. It might be recency bias, but I think this one is my favorite. It’s funny. It’s poignant. It’s explores things that don’t actually exist in fascinating detail. I loved every moment of it.

## Circe
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740"><img class="book" alt="Circe" src="/media/posts/circe.jpg"/></a>I’ve been a big fan of the Greek myths ever since I was a kid. Circe is a well-crafted story that takes an alternate view on familiar events from those myths. I really enjoy this kind of storytelling, focused on giving you new perspective on something you’re already familiar with and fond of. Or at least when it’s done well (I’ve got my eyes on you, trend of soulless prequel cash grabs). Here it’s done well. The story is one of a woman claiming her own path, making the best of a world that was not receptive of her and her craft. Yes, she spends the majority of the time stranded on island. But, that’s the thing. She makes waves despite so much being outside her control.

## Warbreaker
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker"><img class="book" alt="Warbreaker" src="/media/posts/warbreaker.jpg"/></a>This was recommended to me as a way to try on Brandon Sanderson but not sign up for a long series. And I enjoyed it enough that I’d go back to that well for another of his books. Part of the sales pitch also included that this author creates interesting unique systems of magic. Warbreaker definitely delivered there. The system of “breath” was thoroughly explored from enough different angles to make it feel fully realized and grounded. Out of its core concepts we get gods and magical objects and an economy and intrigue and none of it works the way it would in another fantasy novel. And yet it all makes more sense, feeling downright scientific. The characters were distinct and memorable. The plot twists unfold in interesting ways. This was a solid read.

## Gideon the Ninth
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth"><img class="book" alt="Gideon the Ninth" src="/media/posts/gideon-the-ninth.jpg"/></a>I was sold this book as “queer necromancers in space.” And it is that. But... here’s the thing. The actual story could have entirely dropped the “in space” part with almost zero edits. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that this was a last minute re-theme to make the book stand out more. It doesn’t meaningfully factor into the plot (feel free to mentally replace it, it’s not hard). And it’s surprising how much that _bothered_ me... the premise was a lie. The book also made the questionable choice of having its protagonist be silent for a significant portion. She is establishes as a distinct irreverent character (props to the audiobook narrator for delivery of this dialogue)... but then is muzzled. Perhaps most difficult for me was how the book introduces a _very_ large block of characters all at once, each with obscure names and titles, and then overly relies on the reader's retention of all of that. The author will shorthand “the fifth” as one of two potential people out of about _fifteen_. Sorry, I have no idea who you’re talking about. For a story that should thematically resonate with me (I did design a [game about necromancy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/286790/studies-sorcery), after all) this book really _frustrated_ me. It wasn’t so bad I quit on it, but it also didn’t hold together.
