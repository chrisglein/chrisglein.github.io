I don't read books quickly. I don't generally have large blocks of time of reading, largely because I have many competing hobbies and media types. The main hack to increase my "reading" has been audio books, as I can fit them alongside a walk or commute. It still means my progress is broken up into ~30 minute increments, so it's still slow going (If you're looking at a 300+ page 10 hour novel… that's 20 daily trips to get through, or like 4 weeks). But I still make progress.

This series was dominated by one series in particular, because it totally captured me. And that's the Wayfarer series. I cannot recommend it enough. Some musings on that and other books I "read" this year below.

## The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet"><img class="book" alt="The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet" src="/media/posts/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet.jpg"/></a>This is what I would love to see more of in science fiction. It’s optimistic, character-focused, and more feminine in perspective. It’s surprisingly sex-positive too. It’s what I would hope a future _could_ look like, rather than something dystopian or something technophile. The story here is more character-driven vignettes than strong central narrative. The multi-species crew of the Wayfarer goes from point A to point B and as that happens there’s the most delightful world building and character building. The stories are also distinctly science fiction in that they could foundational not exist in our current reality (as opposed to sci-fi being merely a backdrop). But also the stories are all distinctly human relatable. Plus the audiobook performance is _incredible_ (although I admit to having it on 1.2x speed). I loved the book so so much.

## A Closed and Common Orbit
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29475447-a-closed-and-common-orbit"><img class="book" alt="A Closed and Common Orbit" src="/media/posts/a-closed-and-common-orbit.jpg"/></a>No one told me the second book in the “Wayfarer series” wasn’t really about the same characters. I was petulant at first. I wanted more of what the previous book had offered! And, well, this _is_ that, but not in the way I expected. This story explores what would happen if an AI raised a human, and also explores what would happen if a human raised an AI. And they’re both interesting to explore. By the end I was in love with the characters again and having a great time.

## Record of a Spaceborn Few
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32802595-record-of-a-spaceborn-few"><img class="book" alt="Record of a Spaceborn Few" src="/media/posts/record-of-a-spaceborn-few.jpg"/></a>When the third book opened up to a whole new cast  of characters I was more open minded. After two books of multi-species characters, this one focuses on a human story. Specifically the humans that left earth in ships and decided to stay on those ships rather than colonize another planet. It’s a story of that society, from many different angles. Of the series this was perhaps the most detailed in how things might work.

## Galaxy and the Ground Within
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50209317-the-galaxy-and-the-ground-within"><img class="book" alt="Galaxy and the Ground Within" src="/media/posts/galaxy-and-the-ground-within.jpg"/></a>The final book in the series takes a complete turn from the previous one. Now the cast is completely lacking any humans, and takes place on just one hunk of rock. It’s a [bottle episode](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode), with a diverse set of anatomy involved. It might be recency bias, but I think this one is my favorite. It’s funny. It’s poignant. It’s explores things that don’t actually exist in fascinating detail. I loved every moment of it.

## Circe
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740"><img class="book" alt="Circe" src="/media/posts/circe.jpg"/></a>I’ve been a big fan of the Greek myths ever since I was a kid. Circe is a well-crafted story that takes an alternate view on familiar events from those myths. I really enjoy this kind of storytelling, focused on giving you new perspective on something you’re familiar with and fond of. Or at least when it’s done well (I’ve got my eyes on you, trend of soulless prequel cash grabs). Here it’s done well. The story is one of a woman claiming her own path, making the best of a world that was not receptive of her and her craft. Yes, she spends the majority of the time stranded. But, that’s the thing. She makes waves despite so much of it being outside her control.

## Warbreaker
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker"><img class="book" alt="Warbreaker" src="/media/posts/warbreaker.jpg"/></a>This was recommended to me as a way to try on Brandon Sanderson but not sign up for a long series. And I enjoyed it enough that I’d go back to that well for another of his books. Part of the sales pitch also included that this author creates interesting unique systems of magic. Warbreaker definitely delivered there. The system of “breath” was thoroughly explored from enough different angles to make it feel fully realized and grounded. Out of its base concepts we get gods and intrigue and magical objects and an economy and none of it works the way it would in another fantasy novel and yet it all makes sense. The characters were distinct and memorable. The plot twists unfold in interesting ways. This was a solid read.

## Gideon the Ninth
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth"><img class="book" alt="Gideon the Ninth" src="/media/posts/gideon-the-ninth.jpg"/></a>I was sold this book as “queer necromancers in space.” And it is that. But… here’s the thing. The actual story could have entirely dropped the “in space” part with almost zero edits. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that this was a last minute re-theme to make the book stand out more. It doesn’t meaningfully factor into the plot (feel free to mentally replace it, it’s not hard). And it’s surprising how much that _bothered_ me… the premise was a lie. The book also made the questionable choice of having its protagonist be silent for a significant portion. She establishes a notable irreverent character (props to the narrator, by the way)… but then is muzzled. Perhaps most difficult for me was how the book introduces a _very_ large block of characters all at once, each with obscure names and titles, and then relies on you retaining all of that. The author will shorthand “the fifth” as one of two potential people out of about _fifteen_. Sorry, I have no idea who you’re talking about. For a story that should thematically resonate with me (I did design a [game about necromancy](), after all) this book really _frustrated_ me. It wasn’t so bad I quit on it, but it also didn’t hold together in a way that makes me want to rant.
