This is a list of video games I played in 2023 (potentially released earlier) that warranted a mention. 

## Sea of Stars

This is a classic RPG that feels like it came out of the SNES era, but far more beautiful than those games could ever be. The story managed to keep me on my toes with some unexpected mid-game twists. The turn-based combat with real-time button presses (similar to Paper Mario games) kept things engaging (although by the end I was ready for more mix up in abilities). This game thoroughly captivated me and my ten-year-old daughter until we both separately completed it. Definitely recommended if you have a soft spot for beautiful pixel art RPGs. Good music too.

Played on [Xbox GamePass](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/sea-of-stars/9NLLTTJZH40L) and [Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sea-of-stars-switch/)

## Cult of the Lamb

Half of this game is running a village sim, managing your growing set of cult followers to ensure they are housed, happy, and being exploited for your cause. The other half is an action game of exploring a dungeon to grow in power before facing a final boss. The first half, the sim, is far more charming and unique. You create your own religion, from doctrines to decorations. Combine that with a disturbingly adorable presentation, and this game leaves a mark.

## Super Mario Wonder

A classic 2D side-scrolling Mario in the vein of the SNES' Super Mario world. Instead of the Mushroom Kingdom you're exploring the Flower Kingdom, and with that comes new environments and enemies. Each level contains a hidden "wonder" effect that changes the rules in unexpected and often hilarious ways. The end result is an inspired but classic feeling Mario adventure.

## Cocoon

This environmental puzzle game is beautiful, mind-bending, and short. I completed it in only a few sittings, but the entire experience was delightful. Also it has oddly engaging door animations.

## Pentiment

This story murder mystery adventure sure loves itself some typography. I highly recommend finding the accessibility slider for text size and cranking it to max, just so you can see more of the beautiful script. The game itself is a classic "talk to people and make irreversible decisions via dialog" adventure game, set in a monastic medieval setting. Great artistic style and difficult choices. This game had me setting the controller down so I could take a walk to think through how my murder accusations.

## Diablo IV

The first Diablo was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and I went hard. I played Diablo II a ton between high school and college, this time with friends. I played Diablo III (switching from PC to console too), but it never gripped me. This year Diablo IV managed to bring back a lot of the classic enjoyment of this series (and not just because I could play a necromancer again). This time I went deep with friendly multiplayer, which was a blast. The loot perhaps came too fast, but the fun of hacking alongside friends was undeniable. Many good long evenings… until the grind set in, the level differences became harder, and it all began to feel aimless. I'll hop in again if the seasonal content calls to me and I can play along with friends, but overall I feel like I had a complete experience.

## Chicory

I gather this game can be played by yourself, but I haven't. To me it is a game about exploring an adorable black and white environment and slathering paint all over it alongside my ten-year-old daughter. You solve puzzles with those paint brushes too. But the real charm in the game is the way it encourages you to leave your mark on everything.

## Inscryption
[![Inscryption](/media/posts/inscryption.jpg)](https://www.inscryption.com)

This game is not what it seems. The best simplification I can give is that it's [Slay the Spire](https://www.megacrit.com/) meets [Frog Fractions](http://twinbeard.com/frog-fractions/). As in it's a digital card game… that does unexpected things that I would never dream of spoiling for you. When I first "beat" the game I then realized I had only completed the first act and that what followed was a big departure from the game I'd been playing to that point. It was… truly a great journey. The game is rated Mature due to some light body horror and language… but also the first act is decidedly creepy. If that's not your thing, I wouldn't tell you to power through regardless… but know that this game has many different tones. The creators of this game clearly didn't give one lick about commercial viability, and I love what they created.

## Tears of the Kingdom

I feel like I should have more to say about this game. It's more Breath of the Wild. Which is a game beloved by many. I like it plenty. I gather not as much as other folks do… but that's still quite a bit. For this round, the puzzle powers are much more interesting than in Breath of the Wild. And the game is even bigger, which I didn't really need but is not unwelcome. As of writing, I haven't completed Tears of the Kingdom, and it'll probably take me a long time at this rate. It's good, it's big, there's also a lot of other great stuff to play too.
