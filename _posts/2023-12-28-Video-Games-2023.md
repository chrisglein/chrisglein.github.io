This is a list of video games I played in 2023 (potentially released earlier) that warranted a mention. 

## Sea of Stars

This is a classic RPG that feels like it came out of the SNES era, but far more beautiful than those games could ever be. The story managed to keep me on my toes with some unexpected mid-game twists. The turn-based combat with real-time button presses (similar to Paper Mario games) kept things engaging (although by the end I was ready for more mix up in abilities). This game thoroughly captivated me and my ten-year-old daughter until we both separately completed it. Definitely recommended if you have a soft spot for beautiful pixel art RPGs. Good music too.

## Cult of the Lamb

Half of this game is running a village sim, managing your growing set of cult followers to ensure they are housed, happy, and being exploited for your cause. The other half is an action game of exploring a dungeon to grow in power before facing a final boss. The first half, the sim, is far more charming and unique. You create your own religion, from doctrines to decorations. Combine that with a disturbingly adorable presentation, and this game leaves a mark.

## Super Mario Wonder

A classic 2D side-scrolling Mario in the vein of the SNES' Super Mario world. Instead of the Mushroom Kingdom you're exploring the Flower Kingdom, and with that comes new environments and enemies. Each level contains a hidden "wonder" effect that changes the rules in unexpected and often hilarious ways. The end result is an inspired but classic feeling Mario adventure.
