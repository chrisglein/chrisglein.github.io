title: "Movies in 2023"
---
In 2023 apparently all the pent up energy needed to come out and it was time to go to the theater. It looks like I saw _ten_ movies in the theater which isâ€¦ a lot for me, and certainly coming out of the past few years. Partially I was ready to get out, but also there were just some great movies to go see. I got _very_ tired of that AMC movie quotes intro. Please stop.

Alright, whether in the theater or at home, this is a list of movies that I watched in 2023 that warranted commentary. 

## Across the Spider-Verse

Into the Spider-verse set new high standards for animation. It's sequel somehow meets them. The first 20 minutes, which are all about Gwen Stacy, are perfect. I love the difference in her verse's visual style (something the movie continues to explore in spades as it moves to other verses). I love the small but poignant story told in this opening section. It left me thinking "what if we just stayed with Gwen for a whole movie?" But Miles is great too, of course. This movie goes so many wild places. It's so so good.

## Barbie

Hi Barbie! This movie has heart, and pushes buttons. I saw it in the theater on the same day as Oppenheimer, and that was a great choice. So happy to be part of the zeitgeist.

## Oppenheimer

This movie is long and we had terrible seats (the cost of deciding last minute to do Barbenheimer). The movie was also so good that these things didn't bother me. It is incredibly well told story of a time of difficult choices.

## Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

What an amazing year for animation! Across the Spider-verse is a gorgeous follow-up to the movie that broke the mode: Into the Spider-verse. Mutant Mayhem then follows it with the most incredible animation style. And the movie is about flawed teenage characters dealing with appropriate sized conflict

## The Super Mario Bros. Movie

This movie is dripping with fan service directed right at me. And I am not sad to be catered to. Yes, I did recognize all those little musical nods, thank you for making them. Thankfully the whole thing also holds together as an enjoyable animated romp.

## Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves
[![Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves](/media/posts/honor-among-thieves.jpg)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2906216/)
As a player of D&D, I was braced for this movie to be bad. I'm so glad it wasn't. It had very D&D energy. Characters are silly, stuff happens, don't overthink it, everyone has a great time. A delightful carefree romp.
