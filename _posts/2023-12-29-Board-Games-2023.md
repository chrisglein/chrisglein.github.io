This is a list of board games that I played the most in 2023, as well as some others that warranted a mention. 

## Dorfromantik: The Board Game

This game [won the 2023 Spiel des Jahres](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/award-winners-2023/) (essentially the Game of the Year for board games). What if I told you there was no _winning_ this game? It's a singleplayer game of relaxing and laying down hexes. You can play it with other people (and exclusively, I have), but fundamentally the game is no different. Play a hex one at a time, try to score the most points. However when you do beat your score target, or you do something quirky in the game… there are __achievements__. And those unlock new game components, new ways to score… and fundamentally that's the drive that will bring you back time and time again. I've had a great time sitting down to a game of hex laying with a loved one. Do recommend.
