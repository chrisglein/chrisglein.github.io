This is a list of board games that I played the most in 2023, as well as some others that warranted a mention. 

## Dorfromantik: The Board Game

This game [won the 2023 Spiel des Jahres](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/award-winners-2023/) (essentially the Game of the Year for board games). What if I told you there was no _winning_ this game? It's a singleplayer game of relaxing and laying down hexes. You can play it with other people (and exclusively, I have), but fundamentally the game is no different. Play a hex one at a time, try to score the most points. However when you do beat your score target, or you do something quirky in the game… there are __achievements__. And those unlock new game components, new ways to score… and fundamentally that's the drive that will bring you back time and time again. I've had a great time sitting down to a game of hex laying with a loved one. Do recommend.

## No Thanks

I've known that this game was a simple delight for a long time. But I resisted buying a copy. The Amigo production is… ugly. I contemplated making my own printing. It's just a set of 32 cards with numbers on them. There are so many [examples](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2577105/no-thanks) [of](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2685317/no-thanks) [better](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/292942/no-thanks) [card](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/446116/no-thanks) [designs](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1971218/no-thanks). But that time not designing it was also time not playing it. So I bought an ugly copy. And I'm happy to have it in my collection. Watching players agonize over whether they should take that card (they probably shouldn't). The hubris of thinking you'll be able to complete a run and turn the whole thing around. Social strategy emerges from this simple game. I just wish it were a little smaller and a little easier on the eyes.

## Klask

This was the year I _finally_ got a Klask board. I've played Klask plenty, primarily on a yearly camping trip with friends. This year the Klask board didn't make it, so when later there were stacks of them for purchase at Pax West… and I finally had a home that could handle owning Crokinole _and_ Klask… it was time. This game is __electric__. Your pawn is controlled by a magnet underneath the board, and you need to "kick" the ball into the opponent's goal to score. But the real magic is the three "biscuits"; have two of them magnetically attach to your pawn and your opponent scores a point. Thus the game is a balance between trying to score with the ball and trying to not be so frantic that you lose to the biscuits.


## Monikers

This game continues to be a favorite for large groups. If you have enough people and the right stable window of time… it's magic. Over those ~40 minutes you will all develop a shared language for obscure things. And you will all laugh. Reliably. Monikers has never failed to deliver. On the surface it's just Taboo or Charades or something like that, by putting together three different rounds of guessing it really turns into its own thing.

## Spots

What a charming game. You roll dice, and you match the pips on the dice with the spots on dogs. Fail to match too many, and you bust. You choose different "tricks" to determine _how_ your roll the dice. It's simple and the presentation is __stinking adorable__.
