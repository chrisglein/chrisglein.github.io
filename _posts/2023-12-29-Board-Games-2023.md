title: "Board Games of 2023"

This is a list of board games that I played the most in 2023, as well as some others that warranted a mention. 

## Dorfromantik: The Board Game
[![Dorfromantik: The Board Game](/media/posts/dorfromantik.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/370591/dorfromantik-board-game)
This game [won the 2023 Spiel des Jahres](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/award-winners-2023/) (essentially the Game of the Year for board games). What if I told you there was no _winning_ this game? It's a singleplayer game of relaxing and laying down hexes. You can play it with other people (and exclusively, I have), but fundamentally the game is no different. Play a hex one at a time, try to score the most points. However when you do beat your score target, or you do something quirky in the game… there are __achievements__. And those unlock new game components, new ways to score… and fundamentally that's the drive that will bring you back time and time again. I've had a great time sitting down to a game of hex laying with a loved one. Do recommend.

## Enchanted Plumes

This was a delightful GenCon find. A small box of cards with numbers and colors, that's it. You assemble these cards into a triangle of plumage, where the first and largest row is all negative points… but every row after is positive points. But you can only use colors that appeared in the previous row. And you can only hold six cards in your hand as you stage your masterpiece. Inevitably, imperfection and compromise creep in as your race against other players. This game is elegant and portable.

## Final Girl
[![Final Girl](/media/posts/final-girl.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/277659/final-girl)
Quinns was [pretty darn excited about Hostage Negotiator](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/review-hostage-negotiator-career/), but it sounded like a hard thing to get into. Then I hear that Final Girl is a retheme of that concept, and it's coming to Kickstarter. It's a solo game. I'm not sure about solo games. But we're crawling out of the pandemic here, and I went to some weird places. So I get in for Season 2 of Final Girl. The key to landing this game was pairing it with the movies that inspired them. It's a lot more fun to play [Panic from Station 2891](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/354776/final-girl-panic-station-2891) right after watching _The Thing_. So it is that this has turned into a "movie and a game" co-op experience. Watch the movie, play the movie. The game is tense. You're probably going to fail. But when you succeed and smash the killer… oh yeah it feels good. Suffice to say, I'm in for Season 3's Kickstarter too, and looking forward to more of this.

## Clank!: Catacombs
[![Clank!: Catacombs](/media/posts/clank-catacombs.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/365717/clank-catacombs)
I've played so much Clank. The classic, every expansion board for that, the space version, the beginning of the legacy version (really need to get an opportunity to delve back into that…). Clank's great. Build a deck, don't be too greedy, don't be not greedy enough. This latest version, Catacombs, brings a sense of exploration. Instead of a fixed board, you build it as you go. This means you don't quite the sense of specific place as [holding your breath underwater to get sunken treasure](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/6628353/clank-sunken-treasures). But, running off into the darkness is fun too. And this many versions of Clank in… they really have tuned the cards to be fun. I've had an above-average amount of fun with this particular brand of Clank.

## Scout
[![Scout](/media/posts/scout.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/291453/scout)
This game was so hard to get for so long ([Thanks Tom Brewster :/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFZIr5feAPE). But it's great. Make pairs or straights to get cards out of your hand. Empty your hand first and win. But empty your hand too aggressively and you may find yourself unable to play. It feels like a classic card game, and comes in that delightful [Oink](https://oinkgames.com/en/) box. Portable, easy to teach, satisfying.

## Similo
[![Similo](/media/posts/similo.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/268620/similo)
I became wise to this game via the [SUSD podcast](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/tag/ohanami/). It's a silly thing. A deck of cards with a variety of images on a theme. Try to get people to guess one card in a grid of 16 using only other cards as a clue. _Is Poseidon more similar to Athena or Artemis_? Is that a comment on the art, or the lore, or… whatever whim of the clue master? Things get extra spicy when you start mixing decks (_Is Hagrid similar to a chicken?_). This is a great game to pack with you and bust out when you're waiting for food at a pub. You can play exactly one round in the time it takes the ferry to get from Whidbey to Seattle. Ask me how I know.

## No Thanks!
[![No Thanks!](/media/posts/no-thanks.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks)
I've known that this game was a simple delight for a long time. But I resisted buying a copy. The Amigo production is… ugly. I contemplated making my own printing. It's just a set of 32 cards with numbers on them. There are so many [examples](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2577105/no-thanks) [of](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2685317/no-thanks) [better](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/292942/no-thanks) [card](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/446116/no-thanks) [designs](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1971218/no-thanks). But that time not designing it was also time not playing it. So I bought an ugly copy. And I'm happy to have it in my collection. Watching players agonize over whether they should take that card (they probably shouldn't). The hubris of thinking you'll be able to complete a run and turn the whole thing around. Social strategy emerges from this simple game. I just wish it were a little smaller and a little easier on the eyes.

## Klask
[![Klask](/media/posts/klask.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/165722/klask)
This was the year I _finally_ got a Klask board. I've played Klask plenty, primarily on a yearly camping trip with friends. This year the Klask board didn't make it, so when later there were stacks of them for purchase at Pax West… and I finally had a home that could handle owning Crokinole _and_ Klask… it was time. This game is __electric__. Your pawn is controlled by a magnet underneath the board, and you need to "kick" the ball into the opponent's goal to score. But the real magic is the three "biscuits"; have two of them magnetically attach to your pawn and your opponent scores a point. Thus the game is a balance between trying to score with the ball and trying to not be so frantic that you lose to the biscuits.

## Monikers
[![Monikers](/media/posts/monikers.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156546/monikers)
This game continues to be a favorite for large groups. If you have enough people and the right stable window of time… it's magic. Over those ~40 minutes you will all develop a shared language for obscure things. And you will all laugh. Reliably. Monikers has never failed to deliver. On the surface it's just Taboo or Charades or something like that, by putting together three different rounds of guessing it really turns into its own thing.

<p class="playLine"><span class='playIcon bgg'></span>4-16 players, 45 minutes</p>

## Spots
[![Spots](/media/posts/spots.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/372559/spots)
What a charming game. You roll dice, and you match the pips on the dice with the spots on dogs. Fail to match too many, and you bust. You choose different "tricks" to determine _how_ your roll the dice. It's simple and the presentation is __stinking adorable__.

## Skull
[![Skull](/media/posts/skull.webp)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/92415/skull)
There's nothing new about Skull for me in 2023. Well, technically they did have a new pink box release and it allowed me to refresh my copy that was visibly marked in a way that kept it from being playable with six players… but really, this game is old to me. I've _literally_ played it 100 times ([I keep track of these things](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/)). But once again, this was one of my top played games for the year. It's a perfect game. Bluffing, hubris, laughter with friends.
