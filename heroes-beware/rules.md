# SETUP
1. Each player takes a entrance T-shaped tile. Return any remaining entrance tiles to the game box.
2. Shuffle the L-shaped tiles and set aside in a face-down stack.
3. Shuffle the I-shaped tiles and set aside in a face-down stack.
4. Put all square tiles face-down in a pile in the middle of the table within reach of all players. 
5. Shuffle these cards into three separate decks:
  - Invader cards 
  - Event cards
  - Map cards
6. Set aside the supply of gold <img class="inline goldToken"/>, guard <img class="inline guardToken"/>, trap <img class="inline trapToken"/>, gem <img class="inline gemToken"/>, and prisoner <img class="inline prisonerToken"/> tokens.

# OVERVIEW
The game is played over 3 rounds. During each round, players will simultaneously construct their own colony from the shared pool of tiles. After the colonies are built, all of them will be simultaneously invaded by surface dwellers, who will attempt to steal the treasure contained within. After each invasion, players will abandon that colony but stash their surviving treasure to carry over to the next colony. At the end of the last round the player with the most valuable treasure stash will be the winner. 

Each round is broken down into 6 phases:
1. Build
2. Inspection
3. Populate
4. Invasion
5. Profit
6. Draft

## 1. BUILD PHASE
If playing with fewer than 4 players you will need to remove some tiles from the center pile. Choose the tiles to remove randomly and do not look at them.

| 1 player | 2 players | 3 players | 4 players |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Remove 60<br>(44 remain) | Remove 40<br>(64 remain) | Remove 20 <br>(84 remain) | Remove 0<br>(Play with all tiles) |

Once all players are ready, players simultaneously start collecting tiles to build their colony. You may take a face-down or face-up tile from the central pile into your hand, one at a time. If the tile was face-down you flip it face-up and look at it. Then you either add the tile to your personal colony or return it to the central pile face-up. 

The added tile must connect to at least one existing tile in your colony. All open edges of the new tile must either connect to nothing or to matching open edges of an existing tile. 
- You cannot match an open edge to a closed edge.
- You cannot match an open tunnel edge (cavern, small) to an open hallway edge (stone, large).

| <img alt="cavern matching open edges" src="rulebook/DiagramMatchedOpen.png" style="width: 50%"/> | <img alt="cavern mis-connected to stone edge" src="rulebook/DiagramMismatchOpen.png" style="width: 50%"/> |
| <img alt="adjacent cavern and stone closed edges" src="rulebook/DiagramMismatchClosed.png" style="width: 50%"/> | <img alt="open edge adjacent to closed edge" src="rulebook/DiagramOpenToClosed.png" style="width: 50%"/> |

After all the tiles in the central pile are gone or all players have chosen to stop building (no one wants the remaining tiles) begin the inspection phase.

<mark>TODO: Show an example built colony</mark>

<img alt="example built colony" src="rulebook/ExampleInvasion.png" style="width: 100%"/>

## 2. INSPECTION PHASE
Take this opportunity to look at your neighbor‚Äôs colonies. It‚Äôs possible they have made mistakes during the build phase and have tiles that are invalidly placed (e.g. have mismatched open edges).


| ‚ùå |
| --- |
| <img alt="example mistake (cavern mis-connected to stone)" src="rulebook/DiagramMismatchOpen.png" style="width: 50%"/> |

If a mistake is discovered in your colony, you must choose and remove tiles from your colony until there are no longer any invalid tiles.

If at any point a tile is no longer connected through a path to the colony entrance that tile is invalid removed from the colony.

| ‚ùå |
| --- |
| <img alt="example large mistake and the tiles that need to be removed" src="rulebook/DiagramLargeError.png" style="width: 100%"/> |

Instead of removing tiles you may make replace a tile with a _Patch_ tile from the supply (<mark>TODO: Add to components list</mark>). _Patch_ tiles are always considered valid (they may have mismatched open edges or have open edges that connect to closed edges). If you choose to take a _Patch_ tile you must return a gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> token from your stash (see: "Profit Phase") to the supply, if able. You may take a _Patch_ tile even if you have no gem tokens.

## 3. POPULATE PHASE
During this phase you will place tokens from the supply (and potentially your stash of gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> tokens) on your colony. Consult the ‚ÄúTiles‚Äù appendix to know which tokens go on which tiles.

<img alt="example of placing tokens only tiles with no open edges" src="rulebook/DiagramPopulate.png"/>

> Important: Tiles that have an open edge do not receive any tokens.

You may have gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> and gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> tokens leftover in your stash from previous rounds. The gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> tokens must be stored in your colony or they are lost. They may be placed on colony _Treasure Chest_ tiles instead of placing a gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> token there.

<img alt="placing a gem on a chest tile" src="rulebook/DiagramPopulateGem.png"/>

If you do not have a valid tile to place your gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> token on you may instead exchange it for a guard <img class="inline guardToken"/> token from the supply and place that token on any square of your colony that does not already have a token.

Any leftover gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> tokens in your stash are safe. Set your stash aside until the "Profit Phase".

Once all colonies are populated the colonies will be invaded. 

## 4. INVASION PHASE
Create the shared invasion deck by shuffling together a number of invader cards and event cards depending on the current round:

| ROUND 1 | ROUND 2 | ROUND 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 invader cards | 4 invader cards | 5 invader cards |
| 1 event card | 2 event cards | 2 event cards |

<mark>It‚Äôs possible to create 3 decks at setup with the ROUND I, II, II cards. Update these instructions for that. As is this section lacks mention of shuffling old invaders/events (if needed).</mark>

Draw and reveal one card from of the invasion deck. If that card is an invader (<mark>TODO: Invader cards should have a map icon</mark>) also draw a card from the map deck.

The invader card defines who is invading the colony and the map card describes how they will move through the colony.

| Invader | Map |
| --- | --- |
| <img alt="invader card" src="rulebook/Thief.png" class="card"/> | <img alt="map card" src="rulebook/TraversalToTreasure.png" class="card"/> |

Each invader has a number of **hearts** ‚ù§Ô∏è and a number of **bags** üí∞. They may also have additional rules text. 

The invader starts at the entrance tile for each player‚Äôs colony. Each player handles the same type of invader and map traversal, but against their own colony and with their own instance of that invader.

> Important: Heart ‚ù§Ô∏è and bag üí∞ status is not shared across players.

The invader will then follow the rules outlined on their map until one of the following happens:
- If the invader takes total damage equal to their number of hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è they are **defeated** and leave the colony.
- If the invader collects gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> tokens equal to their number of bags üí∞ they are **successful** and leave the colony.
- If an invader collects a gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> token they are **successful** and leave the colony.
- The map may have a condition that causes the invader to leave the colony. 

Some notes:
- Even if the invader is defeated any gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> collected by that invader prior to being defeated is lost.
- When an invader leaves they are removed immediately. They do not traverse back towards the entrance.
- If there is ever a tie in how an invader wants to traverse your dungeon (there are two options equal distance apart) you decide how to break that tie.
- Both gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> tokens and gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> tokens are considered ‚Äútreasure‚Äù.

<mark>TODO: Example of resolving an invader (for now consult the video)</mark>

<img alt="example" src="rulebook/ExampleInvasion.png" style="width: 100%"/>

### TOKEN EFFECTS
As the invader moves through the colony they encounter each square. If there is a token in that square something happens:
- If the square contains a **trap** <img class="inline trapToken"/> token remove the token and deal 1 ‚ù§Ô∏è damage to the invader.
- B) If the square contains a **guard** <img class="inline guardToken"/> token remove the token and deal 1 ‚ù§Ô∏è damage to the invader.
- C) If the square contains a **gem** <img class="inline gemToken"/> token remove the token and the invader leaves the colony (even if they had bag üí∞ space remaining).
- D) If the square contains a **gold** <img class="inline goldToken"/> token remove the token and the invader uses up 1 of its bags üí∞.

Nothing happens when a **prisoner** <img class="inline prisonerToken"/> token is encountered.

If there are multiple tokens in a square, they are processed one at a time in the order of your choice. This means that a guard <img class="inline guardToken"/> token may be encountered before dealing with a gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> token, for example.

### EVENT CARDS
Events cards execute the text on the card and are then considered resolved. You do not draw a matching map card for an event card.

<img alt="event card" src="rulebook/Cave-In.png" class="card"/>
 
### RE-ARM TRAPS
After the card from the invasion deck has been resolved you may decide to re-arm the traps in your colony. To do so remove one gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> token or one guard <img class="inline guardToken"/> token from your colony, then add trap <img class="inline trapToken"/> tokens to all _Trap_ tiles that do not have an open edge (e.g. the same criteria used during the Populate Phase). You must decide to re-arm traps before the next card is drawn from the invasion deck.

After each player has resolved the invader and had a chance to re-arm traps ,draw another card from the invasion deck and repeat the process. Continue until the invasion deck is empty.

## 5. PROFIT PHASE
After the colonies have been invaded you extract as much treasure as possible from your colony.
1. Count the guard <img class="inline guardToken"/> tokens remaining in your colony. The player with the most receives a gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> token. If there is a tie all players with that value receive a gem, unless that value is zero. Return all guards to the supply.
2. Exchange each prisoner <img class="inline guardToken"/> token for 2 gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> tokens from the supply (e.g. if you have 2 prisoners you return them to the supply and take 4 gold tokens).
3. Return all trap <img class="inline trapToken"/> tokens to the supply. They have no use anymore.
4. Move all gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> tokens and gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> tokens in your colony to your **stash**.

Dismantle your colony (setting aside your entrance tile and any of your other I-shaped or L-shaped tiles <mark>or patch tiles</mark>), returning all square tiles to the center of the table in a pile face-down and sufficiently randomized.

Each player then _must_ exchange each 5 gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> tokens in their stash for 1 gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> token. They keep any remaining gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> tokens in their stash.

> Important: Skip the exchange in the 3rd round. Proceed to End of Game.

## 6. DRAFT PHASE
> Important: Skip this phase during the 3rd round.

<mark>TODO: Include picture of the special tiles laid out as for a draft</mark>

Between each round you will get new special tiles that can be added to your future colonies. 
1. For each player in the game deal out 1 L-shaped special tile (e.g. in a 3 player game deal out 3).
2. For each player in the game deal out that many plus 1 I-shaped special tiles (e.g. in a 3 player game deal out 4).
3. <mark>Patch tiles are included in the draft</mark>

Count up the **treasure value** of your stash (each gold <img class="inline goldToken"/> token is worth 1 and each gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> token is worth 5). Your total determines the reverse order you will be able to draft. The player with the lowest treasure value will go first, followed by the player with the second least treasure value, etc. If there is a tie <mark>flip a coin or something</mark>? 

On your draft turn you take one of the special tiles (L-shaped or I-shaped <mark>or patch tiles?</mark>). When everyone has taken one tile repeat the process in the same draft order so that each player ends up with 2 new tiles. Return any remaining unchosen tiles to the game box.

These special tiles can be added to your colony during the build phase. They can be added at any time (including after all the normal square tiles have been taken). They are kept from round to round, even if they are not used during the build phase. If they are ever removed from your colony they will return to you to use in the next round.

Return any tiles that were removed from the pile during the build phase or from player‚Äôs colonies in the inspection or invasion phase to the center pile (face-down).
<mark>Is this the right time for this step?</mark>

# END OF GAME
After playing all 3 rounds the winner is the player with the highest treasure value (totaled the same way as during the draft phase). If there is a tie the player with the most gem <img class="inline gemToken"/> tokens wins. If a tie remains the players share the victory.
