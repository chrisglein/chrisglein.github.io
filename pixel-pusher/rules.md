Build a machine to collect colors and combine them to make tiny pixel art masterpieces.

# COMPONENTS
- 2 conveyer belt boards
  - ==Numbered 1-3 and 4-6==
  - ==Arrows indicating direction of flow==
- 4 player machine boards
  - **Numbered 1-6**
  - **Reversable (6-1)**
  - **Colored (matching score markers)**
  - **Has storage slots**
- 4 player score markers
- Colored pixel cubes
  - 20 red
  - 20 green
  - 20 blue
  - 10 cyan
  - 10 magenta
  - 10 yellow
  - 10 white
- 60 machine cards
- 4 draft ability cards
  - **1st to Build**
  - **1st to Collect**
  - **1st to Score**
- 20 image cards
- 1 opaque bag 
- 1 score track board

# SETUP
1. Shuffle the image cards and deal out 6 face-up in the middle of the play area
2. Separate out the cyan, magenta, yellow, and white pixels into separate piles
3. Put all the red, green, and blue pixels into the opaque bag
4. Shuffle the machine cards to make a face-down deck
5. **Remove 20 machine cards and place in the game box if playing with 2 players, 10 cards if 3 players.**
6. Construct the conveyer belt
  - a. Place the conveyer belt boards so that the numbers are in sequential order (1-3, 4-6)
  - b. Drawing randomly from the bag, fill up the segments of the conveyer belt as follows with random pixels:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 pixels | 5 pixels | 4 pixels | 3 pixels | 2 pixels | 1 pixel |

7. Each player takes a player machine board
8. Each player places the matching score marker

# GOAL
Players will build a machine to collect and transform pixels. These pixels can then be committed to complete scanlines of image cards. Each scanline awards victory points, and the player with the most victory points wins.

# THE ROUND
## 1) GENERATE

> Skip this step on the first turn

Remove all pixels on the 6th conveyer segment and add them to the bag.

Shift the pixels on each conveyer belt down one step (5->6, 4->5, etc.).

Draw 6 pixels from the bag and place them on the 1st segment.

## 1) DRAFT
### CREATE DRAFT SETS
Shuffle the draft ability cards and deal them out to form separate face-down stacks.

Deal 3 machine cards face-down on top of each draft ability card.

Each player takes one of these stacks as their hand.

### DRAFT
Each player chooses a card from their hand and places it face-down in front of them. Once each player has drafted a card in this way they pass the remaining cards to the player on their left. They then draft another card from their new hand. This continues until all cards have been drafted.

With the draft complete each player takes the face-down cards they drafted into their hand. Any draft ability cards are revealed and placed face-up in front of them. These cards will decide the first player in the following phases (with play continuing clockwise from them):

## 2) BUILD
Starting with the “1st to Build” player, each player will add cards from their hand to their player board. Each machine card must be installed to one of the 6 available slots. If there is already a card in a slot then only a card of the same type may be installed in that slot.

### Example
**Instead of adding a card to their machine a player may immediately take a random pixel from the bag.**

## 3) COLLECT
Starting with the “1st to Collect” player, each player attempts to remove pixels from the 1st segment of the conveyer belt. The player takes the matching color and number of pixels that are on their machine card(s) in the matching slot in their machine board. The taken pixels are placed on that player’s machine board.

> IMPORTANT: If there are fewer matching pixels on the segment than that player can take, then that player takes none!

**Example**

Continue with the next player until each player has had one chance to collect pixels from that conveyer segment.

Repeat this process for each remaining segment in the conveyer.

## 4) CONVERT & STORE
Players complete this phase simultaneously. At this point all collected pixels need to be stored or they will be lost. Each player’s machine has a fixed number of storage slots. 1 pixel may be stored in each slot.

Players may activate machine cards they have installed or ability cards they have drafted to convert pixels from one color to another. To do so they pay the required colors to the supply and take the generated color from the supply.

All remaining un-stored pixels are returned to the supply. The phase is over when all players have decided which pixels to store and which to return to the supply.

**Can you un-store pixels?**

## 5) SCORE
Starting with the “1st to Score” player, each player may spend pixels they have collected to fill a scanline in one of the image cards. The scanline must not already be filled, and the player must have all of the pixels needed by that scanline. The player places their pixels on the image cards and receives the scanline’s listed number of victory points (moving their score tracker up the victory track).

# END GAME
The game ends at the end of a round if there are no more machine cards in the machine deck.

The winner is the player with the most points on the victory track. If there is a tie the winner is the player with the most pixels on their player board.
